## Technical Implementation

### Route Structure
```dart
// Core authenticated routes with bottom navigation
ShellRoute -> [home, matches, messages, profile, settings, filters, subscription]

// Advanced feature routes (full screen)
GoRoute -> [discovery, virtualGifts, premium, safety, aiCompanion, speedDating, 
           liveStreaming, datePlanning, voiceMessages, profileCreation, videoCall]

// Authentication routes
GoRoute -> [welcome, onboarding, login, register, forgotPassword]
```

### Navigation Helpers
```dart
// Direct navigation
context.goToVirtualGifts(recipientId: 'user123', recipientName: 'John')
context.goToVideoCall('call_id_123')
context.goToAiCompanion()

// Smart navigation
context.navigateToFeature('gifts') // -> Virtual Gifts
context.navigateToFeature('ai') // -> AI Companion
context.navigateToFeature('speed dating') // -> Speed Dating

// Bottom sheet alternatives
context.showVirtualGiftsBottomSheet(recipientName: 'Alice')
```

### Route Constants
All routes properly defined in `AppRoutes` class with consistent naming:
- Core routes: `/home`, `/matches`, `/messages`, `/profile`
- Advanced: `/virtual-gifts`, `/ai-companion`, `/speed-dating`, etc.
- Parameter support: `/video-call/:callId`, query parameters for gifts
